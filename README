StupidSort

Base:
A database that fills it's db-files with data about words it doesn't know. If sufficient data is availiable in multiple languages it will translate the input-text. Because of the complexity of language only simple sentences will be supported (at first?!?)

Planned features:
Site with a input textbox and a process-button
A popup if a word is unknown to get the information it needs to process it
An output page for the (partially) translated text
Finally the database which should have the ability to sort words by context and choose the most appropriate to represent it in the output.
